# odin-recipes
My first project with The Odin Project
This will be a simple website of basic recipes - mainly high protein meals that I could potentially eat more over the next month while doing a mini-cut before I start bulking up again.
I will be hoping to demonstrate basic HTML skills, including things like HTML boilerplate, basic elements and tags, as well as links and images.
